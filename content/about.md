# About Us

OpenIncite is an independent body founded by a group of computer science engineering students who believe in a practical and hands-on approach towards learning and distributing software tools, especially when it comes to education. 

# What We Do

Our primary goal is to help improve the quality of computer science education by actively developing and promoting open-source software. We work as a team to collaborate and develop projects that help the participants learn software using modern practical industry-level methods. The project ideas may align with this goal as well.

We have a blog where we like to write about things we do and learn.
